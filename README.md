# Complete_PredictiveAnaytics_on_FuelEconomyDataset
The aim of this project is to analyse and create predictive models for fuel economy of cars. Fuel economy data are the result of vehicle testing done at the Environmental Protection Agency's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and by vehicle manufacturers with oversight by EPA.
<br />
Analysis has been done on the datasets from 2008 to 2018, and models created.

## Analysis
Answered questions:
<br />
- Are more unique models using alternative fuels in 2018 compared to other years? By how much?
<br />
- How much have vehicle classes improved in fuel economy (increased in mpg) per year?
<br />
- What are the characteristics of SmartWay vehicles? Have they changed over time? (mpg, greenhouse gas)
<br />
- What features are associated with better fuel economy (mpg)?
<br /><br />
## Model
Clustering:
<br />
Performed clustering on the dataset to get relevant groups of data with similar characteristics.
<br />
<br />
Classification:
<br />
Performed Classification to predict Smartway of a car
<br />
<br />
Regression:
<br />
Performed Regression to predict the combined mileage of a car
<br /><br />
